This is a game. The character has stats and skills and wanders through a dungeon
of random encounters. This may morph in to a real RPG using a hodgepodge of
Advanced D&D and D&D 3E rules.

The screen is divided in to a couple of parts. (Switch to GRID)
* The character on the left
* the story on the right top 2/3
* The actions under the story

There will be an expansion on the character that will open a new window with
Stats, Skills, and Equipment tabs.

The story will be run off of a map. Unfortunately the map will have to be
pre-generated and a fixed size. However, this will allow custom maps for a set
adventure.

The character will run in to monsters in encounters. These will be stored in a
table and selected at random. (they may also be placed on the map - whichever
makes more sense.)
